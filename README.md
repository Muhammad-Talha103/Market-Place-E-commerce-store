# Day 3

# E-Commerce Hackathon Project

This project is an e-commerce platform developed for the hackathon. The goal of this project is to create a seamless, user-friendly, and scalable e-commerce website, where users can browse products, add them to their cart, view product details, and make purchases. The application is integrated with a headless CMS (Sanity) to manage dynamic content such as product details, images, and stock levels.

## Features

- **Product Browsing**: Users can browse through featured products, view detailed descriptions, prices, and availability.
- **Product Search**: Easily search products using a search bar.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add products to the shopping cart, update quantities, and remove products.
- **Wishlist**: Users can add products to their wishlist for future reference.
- **Product Details Page**: A detailed page for each product with more information, including images and specifications.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
  - **React Icons**: For adding customizable icons to the UI.
  - **Next Image**: For optimized image handling.

- **Backend**:
  - **Sanity CMS**: A headless CMS for managing dynamic content, including products, images, and stock levels.
  - **Sanity API**: To fetch product data and content from the CMS.

- **State Management**:
  - **Redux**: A state management library to handle the application state, including the shopping cart and wishlist.

## API Integration with Sanity

This project demonstrates how to integrate an external API with **Sanity CMS** to manage and display dynamic content such as products, categories, and more.

### 1. Importing Data from an External API to Sanity
- **Step 1.1**: Set up Sanity Studio and define schemas for products, categories, and other required data.
- **Step 1.2**: Import product data from an external API (for example, from a public API or custom backend).
- **Step 1.3**: Map the fetched data to the defined schemas and push it to your Sanity dataset.

### 2. Fetching and Using Data in Your Project
- **Step 2.1**: Use **Groq** queries to fetch product data from the Sanity dataset.
- **Step 2.2**: Implement API calls in your Next.js project to retrieve the data from Sanity using the Sanity Client.
- **Step 2.3**: Display the fetched data dynamically in the frontend, such as on product listing pages and product detail pages.

## Dynamic Routing with Redux

Dynamic routing allows you to display product details dynamically based on the product ID in the URL. Using **Next.js**'s dynamic routes and **Redux**, the selected product's data is managed globally across the application.

### 1. Set up Redux Store
First, we create a Redux slice to manage the state for the selected product.

```javascript
// redux/singleProductSlice.js

import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const initialState = {
  selectedProduct: null,
};

const singleProductSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'singleProduct',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    setSingleProduct: (state, action) => {
      state.selectedProduct = action.payload;
    },
  },
});

export const { setSingleProduct } = singleProductSlice.actions;
export const selectSingleProduct = (state) => state.singleProduct.selectedProduct;
export default singleProductSlice.reducer;

```   

# DAY 4

# Hackathon E-commerce Project

## Project Overview
This e-commerce project is being developed as part of a hackathon. The goal is to create a functional and user-friendly online shopping platform where users can browse items, add them to the cart, manage their wishlist, and search for products using filters.

## Features Implemented Today
### 1. **Component Creation**
   Today, I focused on creating the core components for the e-commerce site. These components serve as building blocks for the user interface and will be reused throughout the platform. Some key components created include:
   - **Product Card**: Displays product information such as name, price, image, and a button to add it to the cart.
   - **Product List**: A container for the individual product cards that dynamically populate based on the available inventory.
   - **Cart**: Displays the list of items the user has added to the cart along with the total price and a checkout option.
   - **Wishlist**: Allows users to save their favorite items for future reference or purchase.
   - **Search Bar**: A search field that allows users to filter products by name.

### 2. **Add to Cart Functionality**
   I implemented the **Add to Cart** functionality, which allows users to add products to their cart. 
   - Users can click on the "Add to Cart" button located on each product card.
   - The cart dynamically updates to reflect the added item, including the item name, quantity, and total price.
   - The cart persists the added items even if the user navigates to other pages or reloads the page.

### 3. **Wishlist Feature**
   A **Wishlist** feature was also added today, allowing users to save products they are interested in but not ready to purchase.
   - Users can click on a "Add to Wishlist" button to save products.
   - The wishlist is separate from the shopping cart and provides users with the ability to view and manage their saved items later.
   - A simple UI was implemented to view the wishlist and remove items if desired.

### 4. **Search Bar and Filtering by Name**
   I implemented a **Search Bar** to allow users to filter products by name.
   - The search bar dynamically updates the product list as the user types.
   - The list is filtered based on matching product names, making it easier for users to find specific items.
   - This search functionality enhances the user experience by allowing faster product discovery.

## Future Work
While todayâ€™s work focused on building the core components and functionality, the following features and improvements are planned for future development:
   - **User Authentication**: Implementing user login and registration to allow for personalized experiences, including managing the cart and wishlist.
   - **Checkout Process**: Integrating a smooth checkout process with payment options.
   - **Product Sorting and Filters**: Implementing more advanced filtering options such as sorting by price, category, and ratings.
   - **Mobile Responsiveness**: Enhancing the design for mobile devices to ensure accessibility on all screen sizes.

## Conclusion
In today's development, I successfully created reusable components for the platform, implemented the add-to-cart functionality, integrated a wishlist feature, and built a search bar for filtering products by name. These features lay the foundation for a functional e-commerce platform, with many more features planned for completion in the upcoming days of the hackathon.
